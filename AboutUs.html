                <p>Swadesh Homes Foundation Inc is a New Jersey, USA based public charity that is exempt from from Federal Income Tax under IRS section 501(c)(3)</p>
                <p>Swadesh Homes Foundation Inc was formed by founding members with roots in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The goal of this organization
                     is to assist the economically weaker section of the population by providing them with required assistance that will fulfil their dream 
                     of owning a properly designed home that provides basic features such as a bedroom, a kitchen, a toilet, a bathroom, running water and
                      electricity. Swadesh Homes Foundation Inc has been partly inspired by the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a scheme started by the
                       Central Government of India to assist the economically weaker section of the population with assistance for home building. 
                       While working towards the goals defined by Swadesh Homes Foundation Inc, the organization will indirectly further the goal of PMAY as well.</p>

                         members of the same family that will be residing in that home</li>
                    <li> The combined annual household income of all members of the household should be less than Rs. 2 lakhs, before
