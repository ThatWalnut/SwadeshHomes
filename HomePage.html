        <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
        <h3>Home ownership is the cornerstone of a strong community...<h3>
        <p class="bodytext">If you have a place you can call “Home”, you will have 
            the will and courage to venture out and face any challenges life throws at you. 
            As you face the challenges, you will have peace of mind that at the end of the day, 
            you will be relaxing at the comfort of your home…
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">There are many in society who have not been as fortunate. Even though they have a 
            piece of land, they don't have the resources or time to build a home on their property</p>
